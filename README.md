## Hi there! 🧁

My name is Aidan, and I am a new computer science Master's graduate (Fall 2025). 

I am working towards full-stack proficiency, but I have a preference for frontend development. 

Now that I have reached completion of my studies, I hope to highlight my skills here with some new personal projects.
