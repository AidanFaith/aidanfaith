## Hi there 👋

My name is Aidan, and I am a new computer science Master's graduate (Fall 2025). 

I am working towards full-stack proficiency, but I have a preference for frontend development. 

Now that I have completed my studies, I hope to highlight my skills here with some new personal projects that I will build from scratch.
